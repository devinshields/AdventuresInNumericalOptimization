Adventures In Numerical Optimization is a small collection of examples demonstrating concepts from my favorite online courses:

* Convex Optimization, Prof. Stephen Boyd (EE364a): http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/
* Machine Learning, Prof. Andrew Ng (CS229): http://cs229.stanford.edu/

Both courses contain extremely powerful math that can help solve massive massive machine learning problems.
